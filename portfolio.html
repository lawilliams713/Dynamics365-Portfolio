            <h2>Help Desk Tickets</h2>

            <p>This is a custom entity I created to streamline internal requests. A user can submit a ticket from either the deskop
                or the app. Once they hit save a workflow is triggered that sends me and the user an email with the ticket detail. 
                The user can also attach screenshots or photos in the Notes if needed.  Pictured below is the internal queue that 
                I look at and address tickets based on priority. The users view shows only their submitted tickets that haven't been 
                completed.</p>

            <p>This is the custom Help Desk form on the app. Background process is the same once the user Saves.</p>

                    <h2>Surveys</h2>

                    <p>Surveys are an add-on I implemented in the system to track our customer satisfaction. When a work order is 
                        completed a workflow can be ran to generate the survey process. A survey link is emailed to the customer. 
                        Once completed, I set it to send us a notification with the detailed answers included so we can address anything 
                        negative right away. The list pictured below is just a view I created so we can easily export the results
                        and use the information for reviews and to assess each division.</p>
